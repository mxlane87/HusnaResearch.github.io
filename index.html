        <h2>Key Milestones</h2>
        <div class="milestone">
            <h3>Colonial Revolts and Their Impact</h3>
            <p><strong>Details on major colonial revolts and how they challenged the British monarchy's authority.</strong></p>
            <ul>
<li><strong>1837-38: Rebellions in Upper and Lower Canada</strong> These rebellions, rooted in demands for political reform and responsible government, directly challenged British authority. </li>
<li><strong>1847: Responsible Government Granted in Canada</strong> The granting of responsible government in Canada, allowing the colony to manage its own affairs, was a direct response to the rebellions and a significant concession by the British monarchy. </li>
<li><strong>1850: Australian Colonies Government Act</strong> This act granted increased self-governance to Australian colonies, reflecting the ongoing tension between colonial autonomy and the British monarchy's control. </li>
<li><strong>1854: The Maori Land League</strong> The establishment of the Maori Land League in New Zealand illustrates native resistance to European settlement and the assertion of land rights, a challenge to British colonial expansion. </li>
       </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="milestone">
            <h3>Social Changes</h3>
            <p><strong>How industrialization and urbanization shaped public opinion and reduced the monarchy’s influence.</strong></p>
            <ul>
<li><strong>Rise of the Middle Class (18th-19th centuries): </strong> Industrialization and urbanization led to the growth of a new middle class, comprising factory owners, merchants, and professionals. This class gained significant economic power but lacked political representation, leading to their advocacy for parliamentary reform and the erosion of the landed aristocracy's dominance.  </li>
<li><strong>Working-Class Consciousness (Early 19th century): </strong> The Industrial Revolution created a large working class concentrated in urban areas. Their poor living and working conditions, coupled with political exclusion, led to a growing class consciousness. They began to organize, demanding better rights and representation, which challenged the existing social order and the power of the monarchy. </li>
<li><strong>Reform Movements (1830s-1860s): </strong> The growing discontent among the middle and working classes fueled reform movements. The Reform Acts of 1832 and 1867 extended voting rights, reducing the influence of the monarchy and the aristocracy in parliament. The Municipal Reform Act of 1835 democratized local governance, further diminishing the power of the traditional ruling class.  </li>
<li><strong>Public Opinion (Mid-19th century): </strong>The rise of mass media, such as newspapers and pamphlets, allowed for the dissemination of information and the shaping of public opinion on a larger scale. This gave the public a stronger voice in political and social matters, further reducing the unchecked power of the monarchy and the traditional ruling class.  </li>
       </ul>

            <h3>Adaptation and Resistance by the Monarchy</h3>
            <p><strong>The monarchy's efforts to adapt and instances of resistance to change.</strong></p>
            <ul>
